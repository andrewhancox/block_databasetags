The database tags block is a block that will display a tag cloud in a course. You can select any database instance within a course, and choose any checkbox, linked checkbox or database tag fields within those databases to be shown in the block. This is NOT linked to the Moodle Tags block- it only shows the tags created by the two new database fields.

block_databasetags, filter_databasetagcloud, datafield_linkedcheckbox and datafield_tag were created specifically for a resource database which can be seen at http://practicelearning.info/course/view.php?id=10. It was commissioned and funded by Focused on Learning, and coded and maintained by Andrew Hancox. We are certain this will be of use to others so we are contributing this development back in to the Moodle community.

### How do I get set up? ###

Place the files into blocks/databasetags and run notifications.

This plugin has a dependency on block_databasetags.

Once the plugin is installed you can add the block to any course/activity page, use the block configuration to pick the database activity and fields to include in the tag cloud.
